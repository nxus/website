We are excited to launch Nxus to the world. Its been a fun journey, this, and we're excited to open Nxus up to a wider audience.

With the launch of the website and documentation, we wanted to take a minute and share where the latest information and resources are living for the time being.

## Website & Blog
The brand new Nxus website and blog will be the main entry point for Nxus.  Both are built using [nxus-static-site](https://github.com/seabourne/nxus-static-site) module, and can be updated by the community through [pull requests to the repository](https://github.com/nxus/website). 

If you'd like to help us improve the guides or other documentation, feel free to contribute!

## API Docs

All the API docs (generated from the source), is available at the docs site ([http://docs.gonxus.org/](http://docs.gonxus.org/)).  This includes all the class and method references for the core Nxus modules (everything under the @nxus namespace).

## Code

All the core Nxus modules are available at the [Nxus GitHub organization page](http://github.com/nxus). This includes README documentation (with API docs for each module), and some samples and other useful templates for getting started with Nxus.
